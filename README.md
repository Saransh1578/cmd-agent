# CLI Agent
An interactive AI command assistant that suggests and executes shell commands.

This AI agent is a small Python application that uses an LLM to interpret natural-language requests, generate the appropriate shell/PowerShell command, and (optionally) run it for you.  
Itâ€™s designed for developers who want a faster way to learn and execute command-line tasks.

## Features
- Intelligent command generation using Google Gemini AI
- Always ask for confirmation before execution
